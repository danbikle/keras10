# README.md

This repo is a mix of technology to help end-users forecast the stock market closing price tomorrow:

  * Anaconda Python 4.2.0
  * Keras
  * SQLAlchemy
  * Flask-RESTful
  * Postgres 9.5

I intend for this repo to be deployed to a VirtualBox instance running Ubuntu 16.04.

I offer two types of instructions:

  * Simple Instructions
  * Detailed Instructions

I suggest that you follow the Simple Instructions.

# Simple Instructions

  * Install VirtualBox on your laptop
  * Import this VirtualBox Appliance:
  * https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx3iDDAtxxI4RVZuWmVZXzIxUWM
  * Above Appliance is 7.1 GB
  * Start the appliance and login as ann, passwd: a
  * Clone the keras10 repo with this shell syntax:
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/danbikle/keras10
```
  * Run the first demo with a simple shell command:
```bash
cd ~/keras10
python import_keras10.py
```
  * I did the above demo in my virtualbox and I saw this:
```bash
ann@ub16feb:~/keras10$ 
ann@ub16feb:~/keras10$ cd ~/keras10
ann@ub16feb:~/keras10$ 
ann@ub16feb:~/keras10$ python import_keras10.py

  * Run the next demo with a simple shell command:
```bash
cd ~/keras10
./flask10.bash
```

  * I did the above demo in my virtualbox and I saw this:
```bash
ann@ub16feb:~$ 
ann@ub16feb:~$ cd ~/keras10/
ann@ub16feb:~/keras10$ 
ann@ub16feb:~/keras10$ ./flask10.bash

  * The above shell is running a webserver. You should leave it alone.
  * The next demo requires another shell. So, start another shell.
  * Run the next demo with a simple shell command:
```bash
cd ~/keras10
bash -x curlem.bash
```
  * I did the above demo in my virtualbox and I saw this:
```bash
