# README.md

This repo is a mix of technology to help end-users forecast the stock market closing price tomorrow:

  * Anaconda Python 4.2.0
  * Keras
  * SQLAlchemy
  * Flask-RESTful
  * Postgres 9.5

I intend for this repo to be deployed to a VirtualBox instance running Ubuntu 16.04.

I offer two types of instructions:

  * Simple Instructions
  * Detailed Instructions

I suggest that you follow the Simple Instructions.

# Simple Instructions

  * Install VirtualBox on your laptop
  * Import this VirtualBox Appliance:
  * https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx3iDDAtxxI4RVZuWmVZXzIxUWM
  * Above Appliance is 7.1 GB
  * Start the appliance and login as ann, passwd: a
  * Clone the keras10 repo with this shell syntax:
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/danbikle/keras10
```
  * Run the first demo with a simple shell command:
```bash
cd ~/keras10
python import_keras10.py
```
  * I did the above demo in my virtualbox and I saw this:
```bash
ann@ub16feb:~/keras10$ 
ann@ub16feb:~/keras10$ cd ~/keras10
ann@ub16feb:~/keras10$ 
ann@ub16feb:~/keras10$ python import_keras10.py
Using Theano backend.

ann@ub16feb:~/keras10$ 
ann@ub16feb:~/keras10$ 
```

  * Run the next demo with a simple shell command:
```bash
cd ~/keras10
./flask10.bash
```

  * I did the above demo in my virtualbox and I saw this:
```bash
ann@ub16feb:~$ 
ann@ub16feb:~$ cd ~/keras10/
ann@ub16feb:~/keras10$ 
ann@ub16feb:~/keras10$ ./flask10.bash 
Using Theano backend.
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5010/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
Using Theano backend.
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger pin code: 145-554-526
```

  * The above shell is running a webserver. You should leave it alone.
  * The next demo requires another shell. So, start another shell.
  * Run the next demo with a simple shell command:
```bash
cd ~/keras10
bash -x curlem.bash
```
  * I did the above demo in my virtualbox and I saw this:
```bash

ann@ub16feb:~$ 
ann@ub16feb:~$ cd ~/keras10

# Detailed Instructions

  * These instructions assume that you have Linux training
  * Also you should know how to interact with a shell in a terminal
  * If Linux and shell are new to you, you will need some training before going further
  * Here are paths toward free training:
  * http://www.google.com/search?q=Simple+Linux+Tutorial
  * http://www.google.com/search?q=Simple+Shell+Tutorial
  * http://www.google.com/search?tbm=vid&q=Simple+Linux+Tutorial
  * http://www.google.com/search?tbm=vid&q=Simple+Shell+Tutorial
  * The detailed instructions assume that you have a laptop which can run VirtualBox
  * You can get VirtualBox from this URL:
  * https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
  * After you install VirtualBox, you should install Ubuntu16 inside of VirtualBox
  * Ubuntu16 is at this URL:
  * http://releases.ubuntu.com/xenial/ubuntu-16.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso
  * If you need help installing Ubuntu16 inside of VirtualBox, the links below might be helpful
  * http://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+ubuntu16+inside+VirtualBox
  * http://www.google.com/search?tbm=vid&q=how+to+install+ubuntu16+inside+VirtualBox
  * After you install Ubuntu16, you should install an account named 'ann'
  * Shell commands to install ann account:
```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G sudo ann
sudo passwd ann
```
  * Next login as ann
  * After you login as ann, run these shell commands to install Anaconda:
```bash

```
